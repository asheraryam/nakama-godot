# nakama-godot

Forked from https://github.com/opcon/nakama-godot

Updated to work with nakama-cpp-sdk v142.

## Building

TODO

## Supported Platforms

Currently only builds on Win64. Building for linux, OSX, Android, etc.. should simply be a matter fo adding the relevant platform info like libraries and such to the Sconstruct file. I just haven't had time to do this yet. Feel free to submit a PR. :)
